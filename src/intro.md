# Self-Introduction

Hello everyone, my name is **Justine Ling Ke Yi**, and my matriculation number is **79724**. I am from **Bintulu, Sarawak**, and currently pursuing a degree in **Software Engineering** under the **Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology** at **UNIMAS (University Malaysia Sarawak)**. I belong to the **2021/2022 cohort** and am now in my **fourth year, first semester**.

This semester, I have enrolled in **SSU1053 - Introduction to Social Interaction**. This course has provided me with invaluable insights into human interaction, effective communication techniques, and cross-cultural engagement. It has significantly enhanced my interpersonal skills and helped me complement my technical knowledge with a deeper understanding of social dynamics.

Through my academic journey, I have developed a strong passion for software development, problem-solving, and teamwork. I aspire to combine these skills with my knowledge of social interaction to excel in my field and make meaningful contributions to the tech industry and society.

Thank you for taking the time to get to know me!
