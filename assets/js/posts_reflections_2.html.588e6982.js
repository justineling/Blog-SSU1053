However, the structured explanation of characteristics, such as &quot;passing and outing&quot; or the influences on perception (physiological, psychological, and social), was largely new to me. I was particularly intrigued by the Johari Window model and the self-concept&#39;s impact on self-esteem and awareness. This gave me clarity on aspects I had encountered but never deeply analyzed, such as the fluidity of identity in social interactions.</p><h3 id="practice-of-the-knowledge" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-of-the-knowledge"><span>Practice of the Knowledge</span></a></h3><p>The principles learned can be applied practically in daily interactions. For instance, increasing self-awareness using techniques such as seeking feedback and observing different selves will allow me to communicate more effectively. The insights into perception biases, like the self-serving bias and the halo effect, can help me approach judgments with more empathy and objectivity. I also plan to incorporate self-affirmation strategies (&quot;I am,&quot; &quot;I can,&quot; &quot;I will&quot;) to bolster self-esteem and tackle self-sabotaging beliefs.</p><h3 id="benefits-for-daily-life-and-future" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#benefits-for-daily-life-and-future"><span>Benefits for Daily Life and Future</span></a></h3><p>This knowledge has significant implications for personal growth, career, and social interactions. Understanding the dynamics of identity can improve my ability to navigate diverse social and professional environments, respecting others&#39; multifaceted identities. Awareness of perception tendencies can enhance my leadership skills, ensuring fairer assessments and decision-making. Overall, these insights will foster better self-management and interpersonal relationships, crucial for success in life and career.</p><h3 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion"><span>Conclusion</span></a></h3><p>In summary, the topic has equipped me with valuable tools for understanding myself and others, creating a foundation for personal development and effective communication in varied contexts.</p>',12)]))}]]),s=JSON.parse('{"path":"/posts/reflections/2.html","title":"Chapter 2","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"icon":"pen-to-square","date":"2024-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","order":3,"category":["Reflection"],"tag":["Chap 2","Identity","Perception"],"description":"Chapter 2 Identity and Perception Depth of Understanding of the Topic The lecture on identity and perception offered a deep dive into understanding the concepts of self and how ...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://mister-hope.github.io/Blog-SSU1053/posts/reflections/2.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Blog-79724"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Chapter 2"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Chapter 2 Identity and Perception Depth of Understanding of the Topic The lecture on identity and perception offered a deep dive into understanding the concepts of self and how ..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"zh-CN"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2025-01-08T09:43:14.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"Chap 2"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"Identity"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"Perception"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2024-10-17T00:00:00.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2025-01-08T09:43:14.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Chapter 2\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2024-10-17T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":\\"2025-01-08T09:43:14.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"Justine Ling Ke Yi\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://mister-hope.com\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Identity and Perception","slug":"identity-and-perception","link":"#identity-and-perception","children":[{"level":3,"title":"Depth of Understanding of the Topic","slug":"depth-of-understanding-of-the-topic","link":"#depth-of-understanding-of-the-topic","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Reaction Towards the Topic","slug":"reaction-towards-the-topic","link":"#reaction-towards-the-topic","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Practice of the Knowledge","slug":"practice-of-the-knowledge","link":"#practice-of-the-knowledge","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Benefits for Daily Life and Future","slug":"benefits-for-daily-life-and-future","link":"#benefits-for-daily-life-and-future","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Conclusion","slug":"conclusion","link":"#conclusion","children":[]}]}],"git":{"createdTime":1736329005000,"updatedTime":1736329394000,"contributors":[{"name":"justineling","username":"justineling","email":"justinelingkeyi@gmail.com","commits":2,"url":"https://github.com/justineling"}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.27,"words":382},"filePathRelative":"posts/reflections/2.md","localizedDate":"2024年10月17日","excerpt":"\\n<h2>Identity and Perception</h2>\\n<h3>Depth of Understanding of the Topic</h3>\\n<p>The lecture on identity and perception offered a deep dive into understanding the concepts of self and how we view and are viewed by others.
